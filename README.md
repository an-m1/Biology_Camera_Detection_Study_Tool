# cameraStudy_tool
Started at the CTRL-HACK-DEL Hackathon 2024 at York University, and continued to work on it afterwards. This program uses a camera to scan a human, and a pen. The human points the pen at a particular body part, and it will be dectected by the camera, and bring information about that body part. A good tool for biology students learning Anatomy.
